Hello, CPSC-1301 Students,

This information contains information about this class. I know you are excited and anxious to get started, so here is something to get started on.

First, you can access the current syllabus as [CPSC-1301 Fall Syllabus](https://github.com/ccc31807/CPSC-1301/blob/master/cpsc1301syllabus2021Fall.pdf). This is provisional, but it won't change much, if at all. This Github repository contains all the class assignments.

Second, you can access the required text at [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html#). This is a free, online book. We will also be using [Learning Python, 5th Edition] by Mark Lutz. The current cost of this book (used) on Amazon is [$22.32](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-5th-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=learning+python+lutz&qid=1628115893&sr=8-3). You may find a PDF of this book online, but I would encourage you to purchase a hard copy.

Third, if you wish to use a personal laptop (that is, one owned by you), you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). The current version of Python is 3.9.6, and that will be sufficient for this class. **Note: We will not be using Python 2, and you can ignore anything having to do with Python 2.** 

Fourth, you have homework assignments for each chapter in *Learning Python*. A written deliverable for each homework assignment is *required*. If you want, you can begin work on these. We will be discussing this material in class, and I will expect you to be familiar with each week's material at the beginning of each class. Please note that this class will not be especially strenuous or time consuming, but you should allocate sufficient time in your schedule to complete all assignments.

Finally, we will be reading and writing programs written in Python. This is a hard class, and will require a substantial commitment of your time. I'm not trying to scare you, and we will have a lot of fun. I just don't want you to come into this course thinking that it will be easy --- it will not!

I hope you have a great two weeks before the beginning of class, and I will see you August 17. You can reach me at carter_charles@columbusstate.edu. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions or concerns.

Charles Carter.
